Reason to choose: Angular offers a complete solution with strong support for building large-scale applications and extensive tooling. Alternatives: React is another popular framework, but Angular is preferred for its opinionated structure and built-in features.

Build tool

Webpack Description: Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It bundles modules and assets into optimized bundles for deployment. Reason to choose: Webpack offers powerful features like code splitting, hot module replacement, and tree shaking for efficient bundling. Alternatives: Parcel is simpler to configure but lacks some advanced features of Webpack.

Code coverage tool

Istanbul Description: Istanbul is a code coverage tool for JavaScript applications. It instruments code to track which parts have been executed during testing. Reason to choose: Istanbul provides accurate code coverage metrics and integrates well with testing frameworks like Jest. Alternatives: Blanket.js is another code coverage tool, but Istanbul is more widely used and supported.

Dependency management

npm Description: npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It manages dependencies and facilitates package installation, versioning, and dependency resolution. Reason to choose: npm has a vast ecosystem of packages and is tightly integrated with Node.js development workflows. Alternatives: Yarn is another package manager, but npm is preferred for its widespread adoption and compatibility.

Dependency vulnerability scanning

npm Audit Description: npm Audit is a built-in feature of npm that scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It provides actionable insights and recommendations for securing the application. Reason to choose: npm Audit seamlessly integrates with npm and provides comprehensive vulnerability scanning without additional setup. Alternatives: Snyk offers similar functionality but requires additional configuration and integration.

Static code analysis

ESLint Description: ESLint is a highly configurable static analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It enforces consistent coding styles and helps catch errors early. Reason to choose: ESLint offers extensive customization options and supports TypeScript out of the box. Alternatives: JSHint is simpler to configure but lacks some advanced features of ESLint.

Unit testing

Jest Description: Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications. It provides a delightful testing experience with features like snapshot testing, mocking, and code coverage. Reason to choose: Jest offers an all-in-one solution for unit testing with built-in assertion libraries and comprehensive test reporting. Alternatives: Mocha requires additional configuration and setup compared to Jest.

UI testing

Cypress Description: Cypress is a modern end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It offers a simple and intuitive API, automatic waiting, and real-time test feedback. Reason to choose: Cypress provides fast and reliable UI testing with built-in features like time-traveling, debugging, and automatic retries. Alternatives: Selenium WebDriver is more complex to set up and maintain compared to Cypress.

# Backend API Tech Stack

Programming language

TypeScript Description: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers static type checking, which enhances code quality and developer productivity. Reason to choose: TypeScript provides type safety and better tooling for building robust backend applications. Alternatives: JavaScript lacks static typing, which can lead to more runtime errors.

Framework

Nest.js Description: Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and follows modular architecture principles. Reason to choose: Nest.js provides built-in support for dependency injection, middleware, and decorators, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs. Alternatives: Express.js is another popular framework, but Nest.js offers more structure and features out of the box.

Build tool

TypeScript Compiler (tsc) Description: TypeScript Compiler (tsc) is the official TypeScript compiler that translates TypeScript code into JavaScript. It checks for syntax errors and emits clean JavaScript code. Reason to choose: tsc is the standard build tool for TypeScript projects and seamlessly integrates with TypeScript workflows. Alternatives: Babel can also transpile TypeScript code, but tsc is preferred for its close integration with TypeScript.

Code coverage tool

Istanbul Description: Istanbul is a code coverage tool for JavaScript applications. It instruments code to track which parts have been executed during testing. Reason to choose: Istanbul provides accurate code coverage metrics and integrates well with testing frameworks like Jest. Alternatives: Blanket.js is another code coverage tool, but Istanbul is more widely used and supported.

Static code analysis

ESLint Description: ESLint is a highly configurable static analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It enforces consistent coding styles and helps catch errors early. Reason to choose: ESLint offers extensive customization options and supports TypeScript out of the box. Alternatives: TSLint is deprecated in favor of ESLint for TypeScript projects.

Dependency management

npm Description: npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It manages dependencies and facilitates package installation, versioning, and dependency resolution. Reason to choose: npm has a vast ecosystem of packages and is tightly integrated with Node.js development workflows. Alternatives: Yarn is another package manager, but npm is preferred for its widespread adoption and compatibility.

Reason to choose: Jest offers an all-in-one solution for unit testing with built-in assertion libraries and comprehensive test reporting. Alternatives: Mocha requires additional configuration and setup compared to Jest.

API testing framework

Supertest Description: Supertest is a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP servers in Node.js. It provides a fluent API for making HTTP requests and assertions. Reason to choose: Supertest integrates well with testing frameworks like Jest and provides a simple and expressive syntax for API testing. Alternatives: Postman offers similar functionality but is more suitable for manual testing and API documentation.

API documentation

Swagger Description: Swagger is an open-source framework for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides tools for generating interactive API documentation from OpenAPI specifications. Reason to choose: Swagger simplifies API documentation by automatically generating documentation from code annotations and comments. Alternatives: RAML and API Blueprint are alternatives to Swagger but are less widely adopted.
